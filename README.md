TK-581  

This demonstrates an issue in the development environment.  
ShellExecute to launch a second Thinfinity compiled app fails to render the second app. 

It only is exhibiting the issue when running it from the delphi ide under port 6080.
When running it under the actual server on port 6580, it appears to work fine.


See the example here...
